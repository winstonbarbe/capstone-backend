# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or create!d alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create!([{ name: 'Star Wars' ) { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create!(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
